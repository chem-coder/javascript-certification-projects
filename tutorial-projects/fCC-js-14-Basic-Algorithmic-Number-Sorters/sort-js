bubble sort

starts at the beginning of the array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted.


selection sort

works by finding the smallest value in the array, then swapping it with the first value in the array. Then, it finds the next smallest value in the array, and swaps it with the second value in the array. It continues iterating through the array until it is completely sorted.


insertion sort

works by building up a sorted array at the beginning of the list. It begins the sorted array with the first element. Then it inspects the next element and swaps it backward into the sorted array until it is in a sorted position, and so on.
